# Parcel Project Sandbox

How I build this project...

Initialized the project: `$ npm init`  
Accept defaults

Followed the [Build a web app with Parcel](https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/) tutorial.  
I skipped the last section titled _Declaring browser targets_.

Copied the `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore` files.

Installed eslint to follow [standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) style: `$ npx eslint --init`

Provided the [following responses to the prompts](https://loige.hashnode.dev/configure-eslint-and-standardjs):
- How would you like to use ESLint? - **To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style**
- What type of modules does your project use? - **JavaScript modules (import/export)**
- Which framework does your project use? - **I picked None of these, but that's up to you and your current project needs :)**
- Does your project use TypeScript? - **I picked No, but if you prefer to use TypeScript, the rest of the tutorial shouldn't change much**
- Where does your code run? - **I selected Node only, but, if you are writing code that runs also on the browser, check that one as well.**
- How would you like to define a style for your project? - **Use a popular style guide and then select Standard**
- What format do you want your config file to be in? - **JavaScript**
- Would you like to install them now with npm? - **Yes**
